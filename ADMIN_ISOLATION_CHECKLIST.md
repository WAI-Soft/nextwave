- [x] No TypeScript errors in admin pages
- [x] All admin pages have explicit `dir="ltr"` attributes
- [x] Admin pages use English translations directly
- [x] Public pages unaffected by changes

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Language Change on Public Pages
- [ ] Start on home page (/)
- [ ] Verify page is in English with LTR layout
- [ ] Click language switcher to change to Arabic
- [ ] Verify page changes to Arabic with RTL layout
- [ ] Navigate to other public pages (services, portfolio, about, contact)
- [ ] Verify all public pages are in Arabic with RTL layout

### Test 2: Admin Access from Arabic Site
- [ ] Ensure public site is set to Arabic
- [ ] Navigate to `/admin`
- [ ] Verify login page is in English with LTR layout
- [ ] Enter credentials and log in
- [ ] Verify dashboard is in English with LTR layout
- [ ] Navigate through admin sections (projects, analytics, settings)
- [ ] Verify all admin sections remain in English with LTR layout

### Test 3: Return to Public from Admin
- [ ] While in admin dashboard (English/LTR)
- [ ] Click browser back button or navigate to `/`
- [ ] Verify public page returns to Arabic with RTL layout
- [ ] Verify language preference was preserved

### Test 4: Admin Access from English Site
- [ ] Ensure public site is set to English
- [ ] Navigate to `/admin`
- [ ] Verify login page is in English with LTR layout
- [ ] Log in and verify dashboard is in English with LTR layout
- [ ] Navigate back to public pages
- [ ] Verify public pages remain in English with LTR layout

### Test 5: Direct Admin URL Access
- [ ] Open new browser tab
- [ ] Navigate directly to `/admin/dashboard`
- [ ] Verify page is in English with LTR layout
- [ ] Open another tab and go to `/`
- [ ] Change language to Arabic
- [ ] Return to admin tab
- [ ] Verify admin tab is still in English with LTR layout

### Test 6: Multiple Tab Behavior
- [ ] Tab 1: Open `/` and set to Arabic
- [ ] Tab 2: Open `/admin` (should be English/LTR)
- [ ] Tab 3: Open `/portfolio` (should be Arabic/RTL)
- [ ] Switch between tabs and verify each maintains correct language/direction

## üîç Code Review Checklist

### LanguageContext.tsx
- [x] Imports `useLocation` from react-router-dom
- [x] Defines `isAdminRoute` in context type
- [x] Implements `checkIsAdminRoute()` function
- [x] Uses `location.pathname` to detect admin routes
- [x] Sets `effectiveLanguage` based on route type
- [x] Sets `isRTL` based on route type and language
- [x] Updates document attributes in useEffect
- [x] Provides `isAdminRoute` in context value

### Admin Pages
- [x] Login.tsx has `dir="ltr"` on root div
- [x] Dashboard.tsx has `dir="ltr"` on root div
- [x] AddProject.tsx has `dir="ltr"` on root element
- [x] EditProject.tsx has `dir="ltr"` on root element
- [x] Login.tsx uses `translations.en` directly
- [x] No admin pages use `useLanguage()` hook for translations

### Translation Files
- [x] admin.en.ts has documentation comment
- [x] admin.ar.ts has documentation comment explaining non-use
- [x] Both files maintain same structure for type consistency

## üìã Maintenance Notes

### Adding New Admin Routes
When adding new admin routes:
1. Ensure route path starts with `/admin/`
2. Add explicit `dir="ltr"` to root element
3. Use `translations.en` directly (not `useLanguage()`)
4. No additional configuration needed - automatic detection

### Adding New Public Routes
When adding new public routes:
1. Use `useLanguage()` hook as normal
2. Use `isRTL` for conditional styling
3. Use `t` for translations
4. Apply `dir={isRTL ? 'rtl' : 'ltr'}` if needed

### Modifying Language Context
If you need to modify the LanguageContext:
- Preserve the `checkIsAdminRoute()` function
- Maintain the conditional logic for admin routes
- Test both admin and public pages after changes

## üéØ Success Criteria

The implementation is successful if:
- ‚úÖ Admin pages always display in English
- ‚úÖ Admin pages always use LTR layout
- ‚úÖ Public pages respect user's language choice
- ‚úÖ Public pages apply RTL when Arabic is selected
- ‚úÖ Language changes on public pages don't affect admin
- ‚úÖ Navigating between admin and public preserves language state
- ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors
- ‚úÖ No runtime errors
- ‚úÖ No visual glitches or layout issues
