# Project CRUD Operations Fix

## Problem
Projects added, updated, or deleted in the admin dashboard were not reflecting on the portfolio page. Changes would disappear after refresh.

## Root Causes

### 1. No Data Refresh Mechanism
The `ProjectContext` loaded projects once on mount but never refreshed after CRUD operations. This meant:
- Adding a project in the dashboard wouldn't update the portfolio
- Editing a project wouldn't reflect changes
- Deleting a project wouldn't remove it from the portfolio

### 2. Missing Published Filter
The Portfolio page was showing ALL projects (including drafts) instead of filtering to only published projects.

### 3. No Cache Invalidation
After CRUD operations, the context state wasn't synchronized with the backend database.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `refreshProjects()` Function
Created a new function in `ProjectContext` that:
- Fetches the latest projects from the backend
- Updates the context state with fresh data
- Can be called after any CRUD operation

```typescript
const refreshProjects = async () => {
  setIsLoading(true);
  try {
    const backendProjects = await projectService.getAdminProjects();
    setProjects(backendProjects);
    setUseBackend(true);
  } catch (error) {
    // Fallback to localStorage
  }
  setIsLoading(false);
};
```

### 2. Auto-Refresh After CRUD Operations
Modified all CRUD operations to refresh data:

**Add Project:**
```typescript
const newProject = await projectService.createProject({...});
await refreshProjects(); // Refresh to get latest data
return newProject;
```

**Update Project:**
```typescript
const updated = await projectService.updateProject(id, projectData);
await refreshProjects(); // Refresh to get latest data
return updated;
```

**Delete Project:**
```typescript
await projectService.deleteProject(id);
await refreshProjects(); // Refresh to get latest data
```

### 3. Portfolio Page Improvements

**Filter Published Projects Only:**
```typescript
const publishedProjects = projects.filter(project => project.status === 'published');
const portfolioItems = publishedProjects.length > 0 ? publishedProjects : fallbackPortfolioItems;
```

**Auto-Refresh on Mount:**
```typescript
React.useEffect(() => {
  refreshProjects();
}, []);
```

### 4. Dashboard Improvements

**Refresh When Switching to Projects Tab:**
```typescript
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (activeTab === 'projects') {
    refreshProjects();
  }
}, [activeTab]);
```

**Refresh After Form Close:**
```typescript
const handleCloseEdit = () => {
  setEditingProject(null);
  refreshProjects(); // Ensure latest data
};

const handleCloseAdd = () => {
  setShowAddProject(false);
  refreshProjects(); // Ensure latest data
};
```

## How It Works Now

### Adding a Project
1. Admin fills out the form in Dashboard → Projects tab
2. Clicks "Add Project"
3. Backend creates the project in database
4. `refreshProjects()` fetches all projects from backend
5. Context updates with fresh data
6. Dashboard shows the new project immediately
7. Portfolio page shows the new project (if published)

### Updating a Project
1. Admin clicks "Edit" on a project
2. Modifies the project details
3. Clicks "Update Project"
4. Backend updates the project in database
5. `refreshProjects()` fetches all projects from backend
6. Context updates with fresh data
7. Dashboard shows updated project immediately
8. Portfolio page shows updated project (if published)

### Deleting a Project
1. Admin clicks "Delete" on a project
2. Confirms deletion
3. Backend deletes the project from database
4. `refreshProjects()` fetches all projects from backend
5. Context updates with fresh data
6. Dashboard removes the project immediately
7. Portfolio page removes the project

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Add a new project in dashboard → Check it appears in portfolio (if published)
- [x] Edit a project in dashboard → Check changes reflect in portfolio
- [x] Delete a project in dashboard → Check it's removed from portfolio
- [x] Change project status from published to draft → Check it disappears from portfolio
- [x] Change project status from draft to published → Check it appears in portfolio
- [x] Refresh portfolio page → Check projects persist
- [x] Refresh dashboard → Check projects persist

## Files Modified

1. **src/contexts/ProjectContext.tsx**
   - Added `refreshProjects()` function
   - Modified `addProject()` to refresh after creation
   - Modified `updateProject()` to refresh after update
   - Modified `deleteProject()` to refresh after deletion
   - Added `refreshProjects` to context interface and value

2. **src/pages/Portfolio.tsx**
   - Added auto-refresh on component mount
   - Filter to show only published projects
   - Improved debug logging

3. **src/pages/admin/Dashboard.tsx**
   - Added auto-refresh when switching to projects tab
   - Added refresh after closing add/edit forms
   - Import `refreshProjects` from context

## Backend API Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/v1/admin/projects` - Get all projects (including drafts)
- `POST /api/v1/admin/projects` - Create new project
- `PUT /api/v1/admin/projects/{id}` - Update project
- `DELETE /api/v1/admin/projects/{id}` - Delete project

## Notes

- The system uses the admin endpoint (`/admin/projects`) to fetch all projects in the context
- The Portfolio page filters to show only published projects
- The Dashboard shows all projects (published and drafts)
- Changes are immediately reflected across all components using the same context
- The system gracefully falls back to localStorage if the backend is unavailable
