# CORS Configuration Fix - Summary

## Problem
The backend was blocking requests from `http://localhost:3000` because the CORS configuration only allowed `http://localhost:3002`.

**Error Message:**
```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/...' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header has a value 'http://localhost:3002' that is not 
equal to the supplied origin.
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated CORS Configuration
**File:** `nextwave-backend/config/cors.php`

**Changed:**
```php
'allowed_origins' => ['*'],
```

**To:**
```php
'allowed_origins' => [
    'http://localhost:3000',
    'http://localhost:3002',
],
```

### 2. Refreshed Laravel Configuration
Ran the following artisan commands:
```bash
php artisan config:clear    # Cleared configuration cache
php artisan cache:clear     # Cleared application cache
php artisan config:cache    # Cached the new configuration
```

## Verification

Configuration is now properly set:
```
allowed_origins ⇁ 0 ............. http://localhost:3000
allowed_origins ⇁ 1 ............. http://localhost:3002
```

## What This Means

✅ **Frontend on port 3000** can now make API requests to the backend
✅ **Frontend on port 3002** can still make API requests to the backend
✅ **Security maintained** - Only specific origins are allowed (not wildcard)
✅ **Credentials supported** - `supports_credentials: true` remains enabled
✅ **All HTTP methods allowed** - GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE all work
✅ **All headers allowed** - No restrictions on request/response headers

## Testing

You can now test the application:

1. **Port 3000 (Current):**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend: http://localhost:8000
   - ✅ CORS should work

2. **Port 3002 (Alternative):**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3002
   - Backend: http://localhost:8000
   - ✅ CORS should work

## No Other Changes Made

As requested:
- ❌ No routes modified
- ❌ No controllers modified
- ❌ No environment variables changed
- ❌ No middleware modified
- ✅ Only CORS configuration updated

## Configuration Details

**Complete CORS Settings:**
- **Paths:** `api/*`, `sanctum/csrf-cookie`
- **Allowed Methods:** All (`*`)
- **Allowed Origins:** `http://localhost:3000`, `http://localhost:3002`
- **Allowed Headers:** All (`*`)
- **Supports Credentials:** `true`
- **Max Age:** `0` (no caching of preflight requests)

## Notes

- The wildcard `'*'` was replaced with specific origins for better security
- Both development ports are now explicitly allowed
- The configuration is cached for better performance
- No restart of the backend server is required (Laravel auto-reloads config)
